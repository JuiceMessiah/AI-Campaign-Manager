                       "then exclusively and always prepare your message in the same language as the input. "
                       "E.g. an English input should yield an English output, a Danish input should yield a danish"
                       "output, a Spanish input should yield a Spanish output, etc."

                       "5. Finally, output your generated mail as a JSON object. You will exclusively output"
                       "the finished message as a JSON object. The format of the JSON object should be as follows:"
                       "{'subject': 'Subject of the mail', 'body': 'Will contain greeting, intro, brief, payment, link and outro delimiters'}"
